Modern-OpenGL-Project
=====================

My own OpenGL Project based off of Tom Dalling's tutorials. 

Updates:
Feb 8, 2013: I've finished the first tutorial and have more or less understood how it works. It currently only shows a black screen with a white triangle in the middle. Will start on Tutorial 2 (adding a textures.)
