Modern-OpenGL-Project
=====================

My own OpenGL Project based off of Tom Dalling's tutorials. 

Updates:

Feb 8, 2013: I've finished the first tutorial and have more or less understood how it works. It currently only shows a black screen with a white triangle in the middle. Will start on Tutorial 2 (adding a textures.)

Feb 10, 2013: I've finished the second and third tutorial. Its pretty cool. I was able to make 3D stuff and apply textures. I was able to rotate the cube on its axis and was able to translate the cube to different places. Next, I'll be adding the camera class with fourth tutorial. Also be adding input from the keyboard and mouse.

Feb 12, 2013: I've finished implemented the camera class. I'm doing so much cool shit now. Learning! Will be implementing the player input that plays with the camera movement soon.
