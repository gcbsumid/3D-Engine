TODO List:

- Make Entities either static or dynamic (Update optimization)
- make a room
- Add Add lighting
- Create new shaders

TODO eventually List:
- Resource Manager - So you can get models from files. Research .pak files (I think).
- Physics System - Something simple. Probably Just gravity first. 
- Collision Detection system - Probably need to add that to the Physics system. Maybe add a collision component that has bounding boxes. Keep it simple.
- Logging and Error printing system - Sounds simple enough. Print stuff to a file that says what is going on. Probably create a flag to turn this on and off.
- Animation System? - LOL, this will probably not happen any time soon. Not very important atm. 
- Artificial Intelligence - Also not very important right now. When you have alot of free time and you're bored. 
- Organize the files. Put the systems into their own folders and stuff.
