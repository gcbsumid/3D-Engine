TODO List:

What to do next: 
- Implement the Render and Render Instance functions in the graphics manager using the data
you got from the resource manager (after using assimp to get the data out of a blender file).

HIGHER PRIORITY
- Implement a bunch of .cpp files
- Turn the Algorithms into a decorator type (so that you can do two updates at the same time?)
- Install libxml++ (its already in the temp folder btw)

LOWER PRIORITY
- Make Entities either static or dynamic (Update optimization)
- make a room
- Create new shaders
- Add more lighting

TODO eventually List:
- Physics System - Something simple. Probably Just gravity first. 
- Collision Detection system - Probably need to add that to the Physics system. Maybe add a collision component that has bounding boxes. Keep it simple.
- Logging and Error printing system - Sounds simple enough. Print stuff to a file that says what is going on. Probably create a flag to turn this on and off.
- Animation System? - LOL, this will probably not happen any time soon. Not very important atm. 
- Artificial Intelligence - Also not very important right now. When you have alot of free time and you're bored.  Organize the files. Put the systems into their own folders and stuff.
