# First download and extract assimp - source only from their website.
# then install boost (if you don't already have it)
# then go to the assimp directory and install assimp.
# final note: To those new like me, use "-lassimp" as a linker flag in your 
-             makefile. 

(Use GIT to checkout assimp)
# For debian/ubuntu/mint
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev-all
# For Fedora
sudo yum install boost-devel
cd assimp
